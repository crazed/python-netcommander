## Netcommander
The goal of this project is to provide a simple Python interface to [netconf_proxy](https://github.com/crazed/netconf_proxy), which provides meta data search capabilities. Unfortunately, this is pretty undocumented at the moment, but hopefully the code is clean and there are enough comments to get going. I suggest taking a look at the examples directory.
